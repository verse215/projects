SumOfTwoNums
 Given an array of integers, determine whether or not 
 there exist two elements in the array (at different positions) 
 whose sum is equal to some target value.

 Examples:
 [5, 4, 2, 4], 8 --> true
 [5, 1, 2, 4], 8 --> false

 Classic interview/algorithm question I received during
 an interview process. Solutions are quick cracks at the 
 problem, you don't really need to use the HashMap, I found
 a solution out there with a simple array of bools. There are
 also some versions that use sorting.
